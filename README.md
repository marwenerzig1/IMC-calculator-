# IMC Calculator (VERSION 2)
## A small app that can be utilized as a calculator for IMC.
##### To describe my project I use the CAR method (C : Chalenge , A : Action , R : Result)
###### C : So the challenge is to develop a small application that will serve as a calculator IMC, the application will determine the index IMC of the user from his weight and height..
###### A : I developed this app using Android. So I change some configuration in the manifest and I used java for the action and receive the information from the front app mobile, also I used xml to coding the design and I use the drag and drop method ? SO in the version 2 i add a login and loading pages and changed some design
###### R : The results left me satisfied and I sent this app to my teacher .
